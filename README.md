## Welcome to JavaScript!!

There's so much to do!  Let's get started.

## Objectives

By the time you complete these challenges, you should be able to:

- Write basic JavaScript statements and expressions
- Use online documentation to help solve problems using JavaScript

## Setup

First, you need to get this code onto your machine.  To do so, clone this repository.

PROTIP: Make sure you use the SSH URL

At the command line run:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:gSchool/javascript-statements.git
cd javascript-statements
open index.html
```

You'll see a page that looks like this:

Locate the area that shows how many tests are passing, and how many are failing.
